📦 Complete Project Prompt — Website File Compression Tool (Huffman Coding)
📌 Project Title

Web-Based File Compression Tool using Huffman Coding

🎯 Project Goal

Build a fully functional web application where users can:

Upload a text-based file (e.g., .txt, .html, .css, .js)

Compress the uploaded file using Huffman Coding (DSA-based algorithm)

Download the compressed file

Decompress the compressed file back to the original content

View compression statistics (original size vs compressed size)

The project must demonstrate strong DSA concepts while also being usable as a real website.

🧠 Core Algorithm (MANDATORY)
Huffman Coding (Lossless Compression)

The compression logic must be implemented manually, not using libraries.

Why Huffman Coding:

Greedy algorithm

Uses Min Heap (Priority Queue)

Uses Binary Tree

Used in real-world compression (ZIP, PNG)

Excellent DSA interview relevance

🧩 Data Structures to Use
Purpose	Data Structure
Character frequency	Hash Map
Pick least frequent chars	Min Heap (Priority Queue)
Encode characters	Binary Tree
Store Huffman codes	Map<char, string>

🌐 Website Functional Requirements
1️⃣ Home Page

Clean UI

Upload file input

Buttons:

Compress File

Decompress File

Supported file types shown clearly

2️⃣ File Upload

User uploads a file from their system

File is sent to backend using multipart/form-data

Backend reads file content as text

3️⃣ Compression Process (Backend)

Backend must:

Read file content

Calculate character frequencies (HashMap)

Build Min Heap from frequencies

Construct Huffman Tree

Generate Huffman codes using DFS

Compress file content into binary string

Save:

Compressed data

Huffman tree (or code map) for decompression

Return compressed file for download

4️⃣ Decompression Process

Backend must:

Read compressed file

Load stored Huffman tree or codes

Traverse tree using bit stream

Reconstruct original text

Return decompressed file for download

5️⃣ Download Feature

User can download:

Compressed file

Decompressed file

Files must preserve original content exactly

6️⃣ Compression Statistics (Displayed on UI)

Show:

Original file size

Compressed file size

Compression ratio (%)

Time taken for compression
